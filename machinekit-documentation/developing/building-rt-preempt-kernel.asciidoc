= Building a rt-preempt kernel for Debian Jessie

There are currently no stock Debian rt-preempt kernels available for Debian Jessie

Building your own is not difficult providing you have a full development system installed.

The best way to approach this is to go to www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/
and select the latest stable patch

Then download the matching vanilla kernel from www.kernel.org.

These sample instructions cover the building of kernel 3.8.11 with rt patch no 7

Substitute the kernel version you have for 3.8.11 in the below instructions

I have built all the recent rt x86-amd64 patches up to kernel 4.1.5 using patch 4.x.x-rt5
and all worked well

Copy link:./rt-kernel-config[this] config to a file called .config in the root directory of the kernel sources.
