# Welcome
As with all linux projects always read the [README](README.md) file first.

Before asking questions on the google group Machinekit list,
please make sure you have read:
- [Getting help](getting-help.md)



# Navigating the documentation
There is a matrix so it's easier to find part of the documentation that
is applicable to your project. This is at this moment very much a work
in progress.

- [Documentation matrix](machinekit-documentation/documentation-matrix.asciidoc)

These documents are to be found in the */machinekit-documentation* directory
and will give a starting point for the various topic areas.
They link to legacy documentation and to new Machinekit documentation where it exists.

- [Getting started manual](machinekit-documentation/index-getting-started.asciidoc)
- [User manual](machinekit-documentation/index-user.asciidoc)
- [HAL manual](machinekit-documentation/index-HAL.asciidoc)
- [Integrator manual](machinekit-documentation/index-integrator.asciidoc)
- [Developer manual](machinekit-documentation/index-developer.asciidoc)

### Legacy documentation
A lot of the legacy Linuxcnc documentation is still valid, just mentally substitute Machinekit for Linuxcnc.
This is to be found in the `src` directory of this repo
Where appriate, links are made to it from Machinekit specific documents

### Documenting
the Documenting manual is new and is at this time a working document about
the way the Machinekit project documenting is done.
